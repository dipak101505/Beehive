## Working with the codebase


### Building project from the IDE

Some parts of the project rely on generated code using Maven plugins. These steps might be skipped when building using
IDE resulting in compilation errors. To work around this make sure to build the project first using Maven. After the
initial build with Maven you should be able to build the project using the IDE as it will use the classes previously
generated by Maven plugins. Make sure you don't rebuild the whole project using the IDE as it would delete the generated
classes. E.g. in IntelliJ IDEA use `Build → Build Project` instead of `Build → Rebuild Project`.
